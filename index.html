            As a native Virginian haling from the once known "Peanut Capital of the World", I'm
            what some would refer to as a "Suffolk Peanut." In fact, there's a saying where I come from that sums up
            the
            small-town's ego: "I was peanut born and I
            was peanut-bred and when I die I'll be peanut-dead."
            However, Richmond has very much captured my heart and I have happily resided
            here for the last 3.5 years!</p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            I am married to my amazing husband and together we have a tuxedo-cat named Matisse. I love nature and
            being
            active so
            most of my hobbies revolve around this. Horseback riding, gardening, and hiking are my favorites! </p>

          <p class="paragraph">
            I love animals and I have been working as a Licensed Veterinary Technician for the past 6.5 years.
            My husband and I are both music enthusiast and primarily patron local and touring punk, darkwave, and
            hardcore shows. Sometimes I slap the bass and hit the drums for fun in the confines of my own home where
            no
            one can hear it. However,I dream of one day being in a band. I also enjoy art and particularly enjoy
            drawing
            in pen and ink.
            As it so happens, my husband is also studying programming and thus my goal/dream would be for us to build
            a
            brand together that combines our shared interests around design, fashion, and music.</p>
