        <section> As a native Virginian haling from the once known "Peanut Capital of the World", I'm what some would
            refer to as a "Suffolk Peanut."
            In fact, there's a saying where I come from that sums up the small-town's ego: "I was peanut born and I was
            peanut-bred and when I die I'll be peanut-dead."
            However, Richmond very much captured my heart and I have happily resided
            here for the last 3.5 years. I am married to an amazing husband, James, and together we have not a child yet
            but a wholly perfect tuxedo-cat named Matisse. I love nature and being active so
            most of my hobbies revolve around that. Horseback riding, gardening, and hiking are my favorites! I love
            animals
            and I have been working as a Licensed Veterinary Technician for the past 6.5 years.
            My husband and I are both music enthusiast and primarily patron local and touring punk, darkwave, and
            hardcore shows. Sometimes I
            slap the bass and hit the drums for fun in the confines of my own home where no one can hear it. However, I
            dream of one
            day being in a band. I also enjoy art and particularly enjoy drawing in pen and ink.
            As it so happens, my husband is also studying programming and thus my goal/dream would be for us to build a
            brand
            together that combines our shared interests around design, fashion, and music.
